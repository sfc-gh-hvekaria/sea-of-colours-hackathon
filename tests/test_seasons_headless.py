"""Headless seasons, and the cards they leave behind.

Two promises are worth pinning here, because both fail silently.

A season is only useful if you can look at it afterwards, and "afterwards"
means a different process — so the test that matters is not "did it run"
but "can the server see it". And a mistyped agent must be an error: a
season that quietly seats the heuristic instead produces a complete,
plausible result that measures the wrong thing, and the tournament path
runs unattended where nobody would catch it.
