"""Chaff outranks the salvo, and outranks itself (RULEBOOK §4.9.5).

Bug #16 / rule ruling. §4.9.5 says that on a covered hour **every** seat's
action is cancelled. "Action" includes a launch — but the engine resolved
EMP and chaff together in one seat-ordered pre-hour pass, before the chaff
gate was ever consulted, so weapons were the one action class chaff could
not stop. Two consequences, both live:

* **A salvo beat a flare declared for the same hour.** Whichever seat the
  loop reached first simply flew, which made "answer their chaff with an
  EMP" a reliable counter that no rule granted.
* **Chaff chained into a lock.** A flare fired inside its own window
  re-armed the window *and* re-granted its launcher launch-hour immunity,
  so N flares jammed the opponent for N+2 consecutive hours while the
  chaffer stayed immune throughout.

The ruling, and what these tests pin:

* A flare cancels a same-hour salvo.
* Nothing pre-empts on an hour already covered by an earlier window.
* A cancelled launch burns its **slot** but keeps its **munition** — a
  jammed house never fired, so it never spent the round.
* Two flares on the same hour still BOTH fly. Neither is inside a window
  yet, they produce the identical effect, and so one is simply wasted.
  That symmetry is intended: it is what stops mutual chaff being cheaper
  than solo chaff.
