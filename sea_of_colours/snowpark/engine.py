"""Storage-agnostic engine wrappers — the SOC_* procedure surface.

Each function maps 1:1 to a Snowpark Python stored procedure declared in
``snowflake/soc_procedures.sql``. They operate against a
:class:`~sea_of_colours.snowpark.store.SocStore` so the same code runs
in-process (with :class:`InMemorySocStore` for tests) and in Snowflake
(with ``SnowparkSocStore`` in Phase 3).

Persistence contract on every state-mutating call:

* :func:`save_session_full` is invoked at the end of the operation. It
  upserts ``SOC_GAME_SESSION``, ``SOC_SQUARE_IDENTITY``,
  ``SOC_ASSET_RECORD``, ``SOC_ENTITY_STATE``, ``SOC_GRID_CELL``,
  ``SOC_HOARD_PARCEL``, ``SOC_SHIPPED_PARCEL`` so cross-session SQL
  always reflects the latest tick.
* :func:`run_night` additionally streams every replay frame as a row in
  ``SOC_REPLAY_FRAME`` and every new log entry into ``SOC_GAME_LOG``,
  preserving the multi-day history Phase 4 needs.

    v0.9.6 — N-seat live-play helper. After a human seat submits, we
    walk :attr:`GameSession.agents` and run every seat assigned to a
    bot (``"red_harvest"`` or any agent id that isn't ``"human"``)
    that's still waiting on a submission for the current phase.
    Without this the human locks their queue and the night sits
    forever waiting for the bot seats to "submit" the same way a
    human would.

    v0.9.8 — batched in-memory fan-out. The pre-v0.9.8 implementation
    called :func:`run_agent_turn` once per bot, which dragged in two
    Snowflake hydrates + one ``save_session_full`` from
    ``submit_policy`` + another ``save_session_full`` from
    ``save_agent_rationale`` per bot. For a 4-seat (1H + 3B) game
    that's six full save fan-outs per phase × two phases per
    TRANSMIT click ≈ 50–90s wall on a healthy warehouse — which is
    the slowness the user noticed. The new path hydrates once, runs
    every pending bot directly against the in-memory session via
    :func:`_run_bot_in_memory`, lets night / orbit resolve naturally
    against the same in-memory object, and only persists the
    accumulated state ONCE at the end of the loop. Agent rationales
    + log lines + replay frames are flushed in the same final batch.

    Returns the list of envelopes (one per bot fired). The envelopes
    drop the ``_rationale_row`` / ``_replay_frames`` / ``_replay_day``
    sidecars before returning so the public shape is unchanged.
    Failures are logged but never re-raised so a single bot crash
    doesn't take the whole submit path down with it.

    seats go for the good squares, so a season can lift 39% of the map's
    value out of 14% of its RED cells.

    * ``harvested`` — lifted off the map. Irreversible; the cell is

          disposed GREEN (Nubes_Fissure: Piotr's curve ended 1289 against
