"""SnowparkSocStore — :class:`SocStore` backed by a live Snowpark session.

The protocol surface in :mod:`sea_of_colours.snowpark.store` is intentionally
narrow; this module implements each method as a parameterised SQL call
against the SOC_* schema (declared in ``snowflake/soc_schema.sql``).

Two modes are supported:

* **Stored-procedure mode** (the normal case in Snowflake): a Snowpark
  ``session`` object is passed in (the same one the proc handler
  receives). We use ``session.sql(...).collect()`` to issue statements
  and ``session.create_dataframe(...)`` to bulk-insert rows.
* **Driver mode** (used by Phase 3's FastAPI proxy): a Python connector
  cursor wrapped in a minimal adapter — see :func:`from_cursor`. Same
  semantics; just a different way of issuing SQL.

Insert performance: we use a single ``MERGE INTO ... USING (SELECT ...
FROM VALUES(...))`` per batched upsert so a 25-frame night writes 25
rows of replay in one statement, and the per-day SOC_GAME_LOG insert
is also one statement.
