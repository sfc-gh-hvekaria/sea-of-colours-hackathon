"""What a seat is holding when the night starts.

A frozen board carries whatever its season had, and for the boards
minted so far that is nothing — no EMP, no chaff, an empty hoard. Which
makes one question unaskable: does this agent do anything different when
you hand it a weapon? That is the question the redsign nights were built
around, and "buy an EMP on day one" is the exercise a fork is set.

So a rack is a property of *opening* a board, never of the board. The
board stays the fixed point it has to be, and two runs of the same night
can then differ by exactly one thing.

The four racks are the ones the battles ladder used, and the numbers are
restated here rather than imported. Battles is on its way out and the
lab is meant to outlive it; a dependency pointing at code being deleted
is worse than a second copy of four small tuples.
