"""The turn lab plays real boards, and these tests pin that it stays real.

Two properties are worth defending here, and both were learned by
getting them wrong.

**A board is saved state.** Earlier versions let a human type a board
in, then read one back from a replay frame. The first invented nights;
the second could show one but never play it, because a frame is
rendered paint with no tile and no purity. So a board is a snapshot
session or it is not a board.

**Playing a board must not touch anything else.** That is not a
platitude: ``snapshot.clone_for_run`` re-keys the session row but not
the ``session_id`` *inside* the state blob, so a clone hydrates under
the original season's id and every save lands on the season instead of
the clone. It is silent, and it corrupts real games. The lab corrects
it, and :func:`test_a_clone_is_rekeyed_to_itself` is why it stays
corrected.

    ``SOC_AGENT_MEMORY`` is a hybrid table keyed

    column and the scan stops honouring the equality on ``player``:
    verified against the standard-table backup of the same rows, where

    entries, while the hybrid table returns p1's seven *and* p2's seven.

    rival's day-3 row simply overwrote your own and the agent reflected
    on a night it had never played — reading, in effect, the opponent's
    private notes as its own.

    Snowflake, and because the check has to cover every fork: each one
